# INF112 Project BrentPizza 
The appliction conists of three files. Main, Player and RoboRally. In the player class we find the information and functions related to the player character.
For example their location and the ability to move around the map. The RoboRally class is the main class of the application where the map is generated and 
important functions as win condidtions are checked. 

In order to play the game the Main file must be run. From therein use the keypads to move the robot towards the flag to "win" the game. 


To check the tests, please run the text file and then close the application by pressing on the X in the top right corner. 
To look around the map, you can use the mouse courser to drag yourself around to view the map. 

## Known bugs
For the player to be able to watch the game being won, there has been installed a delay. This will not be a part of the final product, however it is here
due to its information value. This enbales however the player enable the win condition several times before the applictions shuts down.
