# Mandatory assignment 4

## Retrospective
Following from the development from our previous iterations the roles in our team have become somewhat less defined. 
This has been due to the group diversifying our assignments more. We did this due to the feedback that more of us had to contribute with the coding part of the assignment. 
In this last iteration, due to more pair programming sessions and more diversified assignments the group as a whole has become more familiar with the code of the assignment. 
We do notice however that this approach is more time consuming, and we progress a little bit slower than before, however we believe that this approach is more sustainable. 
Our project method that had many similarities to extreme programming has fitted us quite well. 
Creating specific routines and rituals have helped us structure our work quite well without making our work to rigid. 

Except for a period during the second iteration, we are quite satisfied with how the project has gone throughout the semester. 
We believe our strengths has laid in that we have had good communication throughout the semester and have been very dutiful.  
We have quite rarely not fulfilled the work that we decided beforehand. 
This level of trust and communication has enabled us to work quite steadily towards our goals without any major problems. 
We also clearly see that the communication is less formal and more friendly now as we have learned to know each other better. 
The communication is flowing with greater ease now than before. We have experienced issues; however, they have mostly been of a technical nature rather then a 
systematic group issue. We did however achieve a better communication rhythm and assignment diversification, therefore if we wanted to restart, 
we would change our work rhythm earlier. We would also have been able to make some better structural choices for our assignment since we experienced that we had 
to make some major changes due to the solution being too short sighted in the start. Furthermore, we would have to deep dive more in to libGdx library to understand its strength and limitations. Due to these issues we see that our code is quite monolithic and with a restart we would have taken measures to work against it. 

## Justification
A critical part of this game that we have not been able to develop is the fact that a robot can not share a space with another robot. 
As far as we know this is the only game rule (therefore demand) that we have not been able to fulfil for the game to work. 
The reason for us not being able to fulfil this demand is due to time constraints. In the follow up to the last week on the on the 19.04 we decided that we would skip this 
demand and focus more on the other demands that we had in development. This decision was made due to the assignments focus on quality instead of quality and that 
it strictly as not necessary to fulfil all the demands for the game. Another slightly less critical demand that we have not fulfilled is the timer function, which 
is supposed to go off whenever only one player is left to pick a decision. The reasoning behind us not fulfilling this demand is similar to the space demand. 



## Demands

Likewise to the previous iteration the demands for this iteration have been unique in terms of that they are not as defined as the previous mandatory assignments. Furhermore, 
we experienced for the first time not to finish all the demands that were set for us. Explanation regarding these demands is described in the justification section. 
Insight on chosen demands for this iteration can be found both on the project board and in the user stories developed. 


**User story:** As a player I need walls to prohibit movement and stop lazer fire.

**Acceptance criteria:** Players cannot move through walls. Lazer fire is being stopped by walls.

**Work tasks:** Lazer fire must be generated and shown on the map. Lazer fire must be altered by objects in its way. 

**Demand:** Make map interactive and apply game rules (wall).


**User story:** As a player I need to shoot lazers to damage other players.

**Acceptance criteria:**  Player shoots lazers straight ahead.

**Work tasks:** The player character must fire a lazer straight ahead. If the lazer hits another robot the lazer must increase the other robots damage tokens. 

**Demand:** Make map interactive and apply game rules (lasers).


**User story:** As a player I need to see where the lazers are shooting from so I can avoid them.

**Acceptance criteria:** Players in the lazer fire must take damage.

**Work tasks:** Lazer must increase robots damagetokens. 

**Demand:** Make map interactive and apply game rules (lazers).


**User story:** As a player I need to be moved according to the conveyerbelt so that I can progress towards flag more quickly. 

**Acceptance criteria:** Players movement is altered according to the given conveyer belt type. 

**Work tasks:** If player is on a conveyer belt on the end of the turn the conveyer belt must move the player. 

**Demand:** Make map interactive and apply game rules (Conveyer belt).


**User story:** As a player I need to respawn after dying to continue to play.

**Acceptance criteria:** After dying, players respawn at last save point.

**Work tasks:** The player has an lastSavePoint and when player dies and still has life tokens left, the players position must be set to that position. 

**Demand:** Make map interactive and apply game rules (respawn).
